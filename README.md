# Smart IoT RF Energy Harvester

## Overview
This project includes a machine-learning optimized RF energy harvester designed for low-power wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It enhances energy efficiency and network longevity by dynamically adapting to environmental RF energy availability. Developed at Polytechnic University of the Philippines, this repository contains both the Android application and the Arduino sketch necessary for the project's operation.

## Components
- **Android App:** Manages and displays data from the RF energy harvester.
- **Arduino Sketch:** Controls the RF harvesting hardware and communicates with the Android app.
